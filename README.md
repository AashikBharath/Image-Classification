# Image-Classification
This repo has source code which classifies the image based on the trained images. Classification is done with a set of images of both cats and dogs.  Simple ML models such as KNN and SVM are used here for classification instead of Deep Learning libraries such as CNN. An accuracy of upto 60% is achieved with this. A short report of the work is also attached for reference.
